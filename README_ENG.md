# 🎯 Marketing Effectiveness Analysis in Retail

## 📌 Project Description

A large sports retail chain reached out to me for a data analysis service. My task was to analyze the effectiveness of previously conducted marketing campaigns using customer purchase data and socio-demographic information. The main goal was to identify the factors that contribute to increased sales.

In addition to analyzing past campaigns, the client is also interested in insights about residents of **Country 32, City 1188**. A new marketing campaign is being planned for this target group. I was asked to build a model that predicts a customer's propensity to purchase a specific product based on customer profiles, product data, and previous marketing campaign results.

The project includes a full-cycle analysis: from loading and cleaning data to building models for missing value imputation and conducting A/B tests.
